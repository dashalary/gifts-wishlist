Welcome to Gifts Wishlist!

This is an interactive Sinatra application that allows users to sign up, log in/out, and create their own gifts wishlists by utilising the data provided by multiple Ruby classes. Users can create browse public item categories, add and modify their own categories and items, add items directly to specific categories, and more.


## Installation


You will need to install the necessary gems to run the application, such as Bcrypt and Shotgun. Please run the following line in your terminal:



 ``$ bundle install``


 ## Usage
 

In order to start the application, enter the following line in your terminal:


``$ shotgun``



Next, click on the server link and you will see the app open in your browser (I recommend using Chrome for that). Follow the prompts and have fun!
